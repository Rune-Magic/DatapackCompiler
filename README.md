# DatapackCompiler
A Beet Plugin that compiles your datapack into a fabric mod

# WIP
the compiler is currently work in progress, there is no venv and it is poorly documented

# Usage
#### NOTE: only compile working datapacks
Take the datapack that you would have otherwise put into the world and run the compiler as the only thing the pipeline.
**Do not intergrate it into an existing pipeline**  
You can disable the compilation of any file via putting `#no_compile` anywhere
